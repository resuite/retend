# ⚠️ Experiments

> [!CAUTION] > **This folder contains experimental code that should NOT be taken seriously.**

The contents of this directory are:

- 🧪 **Proof of concepts** — Quick explorations of ideas that may or may not work
- 🚧 **Half-finished tests** — Incomplete implementations abandoned mid-development
- 🗑️ **Unnecessary code** — Things that probably shouldn't exist but do anyway

**Do not rely on any code in this folder.** It may be broken, incomplete, or completely wrong. If something here looks useful, consider rewriting it properly in the main codebase instead of copying it directly.
