Retend is a framework for building fast and fluid web apps. Like React, it allows you to use JSX to create dynamic user interfaces.

If you've worked with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Retend should be easy to pick up. It is designed to help you build applications quickly and efficiently.

## Key Features

Here's a breakdown of the core functionalities:

- **Lightweight:** Retend has a small footprint, which means it loads quickly without extra overhead.

- **JSX Support:** You can use JSX to define your user interfaces. This allows you embed HTML-like structures directly into JavaScript.

- **Built-in Reactivity:** [`@adbl/cells`](https://github.com/adebola-io/cells) is used for reactivity. This means that parts of your UI that depend on data will automatically update, without the need for manual triggering or rerenders.

- **Components are DOM Elements:** Components in Retend are just functions that return elements.

  - There is no extra layer.
  - There is no Virtual DOM.
  - There is no "re-render".

  This gives you a high level of control and interoperability with existing DOM APIs.

- **Built-in Router:** The library includes its own router, which makes it easier to build single-page applications. The router handles navigation between parts of your app without full page reloads.

- **(Experimental) Fast Refresh Support:** Retend supports hot module reloads, which allow you to see changes instantly without refreshing the page. This speeds up development by letting you focus more on your application.

## Installation

> `NOTE`: This section assumes you already have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. If you don't, you can download them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

To get started with Retend, you'll need to create a new project using our scaffolding tool.

This will set up the basic project structure for you. Then, you'll need to install dependencies and start the development server.

- **Create a new project:**

  Open your terminal in your documents directory, and run the following command:

  ```bash
  npx retend-start
  ```

  This command will prompt you for some details about your project (such as the name, if you want to use Tailwind etc.) and will generate the necessary project files.

- **Navigate to your project directory:**

  After creating the project, navigate into the project by using `cd` and the name you used:

  ```shell
  cd your-project-name
  ```

- **Install dependencies:**

  Run the following command to install all the required packages for your project:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Start the development server:**

  Finally, start the development server using this command in the same directory:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

  This command will start a local development server, and you'll be able to see your application at `http://localhost:5229` in your browser.
